CONVENTIONS
--
    This file describes both architecture and style conventions for xy.


ARCHITECTURE
--
    A module is typically a pair of header and source files that encompass some
    discreet piece of functionality, library abstraction, or set of related
    functions.  Each module should use no more than the core headers and should
    attempt to stand alone to whatever extent is reasonable.

    Modules are built as objects and will be linked into the xy executable at the
    end of the build process.


STYLE
--
    SOURCE CODE
        * Resembles K&R-style C
        * 80 character line limit

    DESIGN
        * Modules should attempt to stand on their own
        * Modules should attempt to layer a level of abstraction on top of
          whatever functionality is being exposed.  For instance, the XLIB
          module makes an attempt to keep X functions, types, etc., out of the
          interface.
