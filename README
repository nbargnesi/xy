HACKING
--
    This file describes working with the tree. 


CONFIGURING AND BUILDING
--
    To build, simply:
        ./configure --enable-tests && make

    To clean the build:
        make clean

    To rebuild:
        make all (or just 'make')

    Together:
        make clean all

    To _really_ clean the tree, use either:
        make distclean
        or
        make mc

    In the latter target, 'mc' stands for "maintainer clean" and is intended to
    be used by autotool maintainers.


ADDING NEW MODULES
--
    To add a new module, start with a clean source tree, and make the necessary
    modifications to lib/Makefile.am, src/Makefile.am, and tests/Makefile.am.
    From the top of the tree, regenerate the autotools artifacts via autoreconf.
    Building the tree will now include the additional module.
