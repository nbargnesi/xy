HACKING
--
    This file describes working with the tree. 


CONFIGURING AND BUILDING
--
    To build, simply:
        ./configure && make

    To clean the build:
        make clean

    To rebuild:
        make all (or just 'make')

    Together:
        make clean all

    To _really_ clean the tree, use either:
        make distclean
        or
        make mc

    In the latter target, 'mc' stands for "maintainer clean" and is intended to
    be used by autotool maintainers.


ADDING NEW MODULES
--
    To add a new module, start with a clean source tree, and append the source
    file(s) to the end of xy_SOURCES in src/Makefile.am.  From the top of the tree,
    regenerate the autotools artifacts via autoreconf.  Building the tree will now
    include the additional module.
